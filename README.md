# Music Functions

This is a library for helping with tasks related to music. I'm making it for myself mostly but it's open source so if you find it, and find it useful, that's great!

## What can you do with this

- Give a chord name and get the notes
- Give a scale name and get the notes
- Give a key name and get a bunch of information
